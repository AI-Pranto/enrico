ENRICO: Exascale Nuclear Reactor Investigative COde
===================================================

ENRICO is an application that automates the workflow for solving a coupled
particle transport, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics problem. Currently
supported solvers include the `OpenMC <https://openmc.readthedocs.io>`_ and
Shift Monte Carlo codes and the `Nek5000 <https://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov>`_
computational fluid dynamics code. In addition, several simplified surrogate
physics models are available for obtaining approximate solutions that can be
used either to accelerate convergence or for testing.
